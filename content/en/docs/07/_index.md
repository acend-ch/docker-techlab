Now that we have a "backend", why not deploy a frontend container (e.g. httpd & php) and make them speak to each other?


## Deploying a frontend container

First thing: Find the fitting Docker image --> Where? Exactly... [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

Use the `php:8-apache` image.

{{% onlyWhenNot mobi %}}
```bash
docker pull php:8-apache
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen mobi %}}
```bash
docker pull <registry-url>/puzzle/k8s/kurs/php:8-apache
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

Once it is pulled check your local `docker images`:

```bash
docker images
```

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
php                 8-apache            41f84befd707        5 days ago          390MB
mariadb             latest              58730544b81b        2 weeks ago         397MB
hello-world         latest              1815c82652c0        2 months ago        1.84kB
hello-world         linux               1815c82652c0        2 months ago        1.84kB

```

This will show the images in the local registry with their name and tags.

By using `docker pull php:8-apache` Docker downloaded the `php` image with the `8-apache` tag. If you omit the tag
(so here `docker pull php`) docker would try to download the image with the `latest` tag.

For the hello-world image we see that we have the same image (read same image id) but two different tags (linux/latest).

Now deploy the new container using the correct tag:

{{% onlyWhenNot mobi %}}
```bash
docker run -d --name apache-php php:8-apache
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen mobi %}}
```bash
docker run -d --name apache-php <registry-url>/puzzle/k8s/kurs/php:8-apache
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

`docker ps` shows all running containers. Check that `apache-php` is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
b901d6c0473a        php:8-apache        "docker-php-entryp..."   18 seconds ago      Up 17 seconds       80/tcp              apache-php
50197361e87b        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   42 minutes ago      Up 42 minutes       3306/tcp            mariadb-container-with-existing-external-volume
6f08ac657320        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   4 hours ago         Up 2 hours          3306/tcp            mariadb-container

```

Now, try to connect to the server using the container-assigned docker IP address:

Use the familiar command from lab 5:

```bash
docker inspect apache-php -f '{{ range.NetworkSettings.Networks }}{{ .IPAddress }}{{ end }}'
```
Which will show only the IP of the container as output:

```
172.17.0.4
```

With this IP navigate to the web server at <http://172.17.0.4>.

{{% alert title="Note for Webshell" color="primary" %}}
As we don't have a browser in the webshell use `curl http://172.17.0.4` to open the page in your terminal.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Note for Windows and macOS" color="primary" %}}
As the Docker Linux bridge is not reachable from your Windows or macOS host you cannot access the container directly via IP address.
See:

* <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/>
* <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/>

If you've already started the `apache-php` container without port forwarding you have to stop and remove it first:

```bash
docker stop apache-php
docker rm apache-php
```

Now start the container again with port forwarding:

{{% onlyWhenNot mobi %}}
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -d --name apache-php php:8-apache
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen mobi %}}
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -d --name apache-php <registry-url>/puzzle/k8s/kurs/php:8-apache
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

Now you can access the web server at <http://LOCALHOST:8080>.
{{% /alert %}}

Unfortunately we get a "403 Error - Forbidden".

{{% details title="ðŸ¤” Where is this error from? Docker?" %}}
403 is the error code from the apache container. There is some configuration missing:
The Apache web server does not allow you to scan its own document root.
{{% /details %}}

{{% details title="ðŸ¤” Can I only access the webserver through its local IP?" %}}
Docker can port-forward your request to a running container. In a windows environment you have just used this feature. But more explanation in the next lab.
{{% /details %}}

For now stop and remove this container:

```bash
docker stop apache-php
docker rm apache-php
```
